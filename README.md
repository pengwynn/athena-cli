# athena-cli

A CLI for Amazon Athena, powered by JRuby.

[Amazon Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/) allows you to define a schema and query structured data in S3 without the usual Extract-Transform-Load process. This project uses the [JDBC driver](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/connect-with-jdbc.html) and JRuby to bring Athena access to your terminal.

##### _athena-cli is a rapidly evolving work in progress. Some parts of this README are [aspirational](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html)._

#### Installation

Make sure you have JRuby >= 9.1.6.0.

    jruby -v

Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/pengwynn/athena-cli

Install the dependencies:

    bundle install

Build the gem:

    rake gem

Install it locally

    gem install pkg/athena-cli-<version>.gem

##### TODO: Install via Rubygems:

##### Setting up AWS credentials

The app will look for your AWS key and secret in the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_SECRET_KEY` environment variables. If you use multiple AWS accounts, [awsam](https://github.com/mheffner/awsam) makes that a snap. Otherwise, you'll need to supply your AWS key and secret on every command via `--key` and `--secret` flags.

##### Configuring the JDBC driver

The underlying Java code needs to know where to find your [JDBC
driver](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/connect-with-jdbc.html#downloading-the-driver). Add the path to your `CLASSPATH` environment variable. Something like:


Example:

    export CLASSPATH="$CLASSPATH:~/src/AthenaJDB41-1.0.0.jar"

##### Setting the scratch folder

Athena requires an S3 scratch folder for storing results. You'll need to set the `ATHENA_S3_STAGING_DIR` environment variable or pass via the `--staging-dir` command line flag.

##### Check your settings

    athena-cli doctor
